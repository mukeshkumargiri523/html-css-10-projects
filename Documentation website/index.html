            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such
            as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host
            environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
            connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

        <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast
            executionand type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you
            can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private
            memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model
            means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their
            methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally
            require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make
            Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.

        <h2>ECMAScript specification</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European
            association for standardizing information and communication systems
            (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer
            Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international
            programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version
            of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all
            applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open
            standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The
            ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International
            Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262. You can also find
            the specification on the Ecma International website. The ECMAScript
            specification does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM),
            which is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or
            WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). The DOM
            defines the way in which HTML document objects are exposed to your
            script. To get a better idea about the different technologies that
            are used when programming with JavaScript, consult the article
            JavaScript technologies overview.

        <h2>Loops and Iteration</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where
            you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in
            another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be
            expressed this way as a loop:
          </p>
          <div class="codes">
            <code
              >for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) { // Runs 5 times, with
              values of step 0 through 4. console.log("Walking east one step");
              }</code
            >
          </div>
          <p>
            There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do
            the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note
            that it's possible that number could be zero!). The various loop
            mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end
            points of the loop. There are various situations that are more
            easily served by one type of loop over the others.

      <section id="Functions">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
            A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of
            statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a
            procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and
            return an output where there is some obvious relationship between
            the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it
            somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parameters are essentially passed to functions by value — so if the
            code within the body of a function assigns a completely new value to
            a parameter that was passed to the function, the change is not
            reflected globally or in the code which called that function.When
            you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the
            object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as
            shown in the following example:
          </p>
          <div class="codes">
            <code
              >function myFunc(theObject) { theObject.make = "Toyota"; } const
              mycar = { make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998, }; // x gets
              the value "Honda" const x = mycar.make; // the make property is
              changed by the function myFunc(mycar); // y gets the value
              "Toyota" const y = mycar.make;</code
            >
          </div>

        <h2>Expressions and operators</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators,
            including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical,
            string, ternary and more. At a high level, an expression is a valid
            unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of
            expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values)
            and those that purely evaluate. The expression x = 7 is an example
            of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the
            value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

        <h2>Control flow</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically
            control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great
            deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an
            overview of these statements. The JavaScript reference contains
            exhaustive details about the statements in this chapter. The
            semicolon (;) character is used to separate statements in JavaScript
            code. Any JavaScript expression is also a statement. See Expressions
            and operators for complete information about expressions.
